# Face Generation with DCGAN

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to generate realistic faces using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN). The CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) is employed to train the adversarial networks. The dataset consists of over 200,000 celebrity images, each cropped to focus on the face and resized to 64x64 pixels.
